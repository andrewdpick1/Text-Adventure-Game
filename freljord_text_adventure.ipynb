A cold breeze brushes against your skin, making the hairs stand on edge. Though the cold does not bother you in the
slightest. You look over your shoulder to see a burly man dressed in a fur coat that oddly cut off at the shoulders,
leaving his arms bare in the bitter cold. Apparently he's not the only one accustomed to the cold. After shutting the
door behind him and walking into to light, his scarred and muscular physique, and the battleaxe on his hip made it clear
that he was no ordinary man. His long golden hair fell behind his mountainous shoulders and his beard was as long as
any woman's head of hair. As the people in the bar notice his entrance, the commotion dies down as the patrons' eyes
are glued to the newcomer. The man, towering above everyone else, steadily walked towards you as, snow falling off his
boots with each step. The creaking of the floorboards stop when he reaches the bar where you stand.

The man's stern expression softened into a faint smile. "Oh yeah? What business does a bar tender have going on an expedition?
You gonna fight with made-up stories? Throw tankards of ale at the enemy until they surrender?"  He laughs heartily, his eyes
narrowing in a playful yet challenging manner. You don't laugh. Your mind drifts back to the past, memories of war, bloodshed,
and loss. You left that life behind you, seeking a quieter life, a break from the ceaseless fighting. But now as this stranger
speaks of troubles that may shake the very foundations of the Freljord, a spark of your past courage reignites. A part of you
longs yet to make an impact on the Freljord, the icy region you have called home since birth. "I wouldn't be so quick to assume.
I've got history with the Winter's Claw; served under Sejuani herself. Fought in battles that could freeze a man's heart."
"Hmpf. I guess there's more to you than meets the eye. What's your weapon of choice then?" He replies with an inquisitive look
on his face. "Well, let me go grab it for you." You walk from behind the bar and open the door to your room. In the corner of
the room, you dust off a chest and unlatch its clasp before opening the creaky container. Inside you see...

print('''1. a radiant blade, its ethereal form radiating an icy glow that dances in hues of turquoise blue as if capturing the
essence of frozen starlight. The meticulously crafted steel cross guard encases two mesmerizing gems of pure blue true ice, 
their crystalline symmetry a testament to the harmonious fusion of magic and craftsmanship. The sword of true ice emanates an 
otherworldly chill, a weapon of both elegance and power: Glacial Hailblade.
2. a crystalline bow with limbs that shimmer with an icy brilliance, refracting the ambient light into a cascade of frozen hues.
The bowstring, woven from the sinew of frostguard thralls, hums with an ethereal resonance. The grip, carved with ancient 
Freljordian patterns, channels the very essence of winter with each arrow loosed. A true ice weapon of both elegance and power:
Winter's Wrath.
3. a one-sided battle-axe hewn from the heart of an enchanted glacier. Its razor-sharp edge glows with an icy luminescence, 
leaving a frosty residue in its wake. The haft, etched with ancient Freljordian symbols, resonates with the raw power of winter.
Carved with intricate Freljordian patterns, the Glacial Frostrend channels the very spirit of winter with each resolute swing. 
The axe's single, razor-sharp edge of true ice evokes both finesse and strength, making it a symbol of frigid might and refined
brutality. A weapon of both elegance and power: Frostfury.''')

There's a small outpost not far from here. If we make haste we can resupply there by day's end."

poker, blackjack, and other games. Dim lighting and the hum of chatter create an immersive experience.

1. Maybe the bartender over there has information the one talking to Ragnar doesn't. Go sit down and order a drink.
